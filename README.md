# ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction Model â€“ Your First MLOps Project (FastAPI + Docker + K8s + Helm + GitHub Actions)


This project helped me learn **Building and Deploying an ML Model** using a simple and real-world use case: predicting whether a person is diabetic based on health metrics. Weâ€™ll go from:

- âœ… Model Training
- âœ… Building the Model locally
- âœ… API Deployment with FastAPI
- âœ… Dockerization
- âœ… Kubernetes Deployment
- âœ… Helm Chart for Kubernetes Deployment
- âœ… GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## ðŸ“Š Problem Statement

Predict if a person is diabetic based on:
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- BMI
- Age

We use a Random Forest Classifier trained on the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iam-veeramalla/first-mlops-project.git
cd first-mlops-project
```

### 2. Install UV (python package manager)

```
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment

```
uv venv .mlops
source .mlops/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Train the Model

```
python3 train.py
```

## Run the API Locally

```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### Sample Input for /predict

```
{
  "Pregnancies": 2,
  "Glucose": 130,
  "BloodPressure": 70,
  "BMI": 28.5,
  "Age": 45
}
```

## Dockerize the API

### Build the Docker Image

```
docker build -t diabetes-prediction-mlops-project .
```

### Run the Container

```
docker run -p 8000:8000 diabetes-prediction-mlops-project
```

## Deploy to Kubernetes with manifests

```
kubectl apply -f k8s-deploy.yml
```

## Deploy to Kubernetes with helm chart

```
helm install diabetes-prediction-mlops-project helm-chart
```

## Delete the Deployment

```
kubectl delete -f k8s-deploy.yml
```

## Delete the Helm Chart

```
helm delete diabetes-prediction-mlops-project
```
